# Branching and Releases

![Branching strategy](/img/docs-internal/conventions/branching.jpg)

- Our primary branch is called `main` and never ~~`master`~~
- We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`breaking.feature.patch`)
- We don't prepend `v` to our version numbers
- We use mono repos (Frontend + Backend + Environment Infrastructure) in one repository
