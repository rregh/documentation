# wemogy Autocomplete service

## What is the wemogy Autocomplete Service?

The wemogy autocomplete service can be used to quickly implement autocomplete support for string fields of your application.

### Which field types are supported?

- String fields
- String array fields (To be implemented!)

## Q&A

### Autocomplete.ignore?

You can ignore pathes from autocomplete by adding them to the config

```<yaml>
ignore:
  # ignore a single property
  - /fullname
  # ignore all properties of an object
  - /iptc/*
```

### Multiple fields with same autocomplete source?

If multiple fields should have the same autocomplete source, you can just configure the dependency in the frontend.

// To be implemented!

```<yaml>
merge:
  - namespace: 'firstname'
    properties:
    - /firstname
    - /billingAddress/firstname
    - /shippingAddress/firstname
```

### Multi-Tenancy or multiple autocomplete sources for the same field?

Multi-Tenancy means that you can have different autocomplete sources for different tenants.

Multiple autocomplete sources for the same field means that you can have more then one autocomplete source for a single field. This you may need if your application supports different actors (data collector, quality assurer) and each actor should have its own autocomplete source.

Each autocomplete source is associated with a **namespace id**. A namespace id can be:

- One namespace per tenant: `tenantId`
- One namespace per customer: `customerId`
- One namespace per form and actor: `formId-actorId`

### How does authorization works?

wemogy Authorization don't cares about authorization, please implement the logic on your own. In the following you find a reference usage implementation:

The types of users:

- Anonymous Consumer
  - Only consuming the autocomplete sources to get the autocomplete suggestions. (**GET** request)
- Consumer
  - Consuming the autocomplete sources to get the autocomplete suggestions. (**GET** request)
  - Usage will be reported (**POST** reportUsage)
    - the occurrence and last used will be updated in existing autocomplete items
    - new autocomplete items will be ignored
- Autocomplete Contributor (**POST** contribute)
  - Can update autocomplete sources.

GET `https://myapp.com/api/autocomplete/namespace-parts/propertyName`
